## RabbitMQ AWS infrastructure Plugin

This plugin is specifically for RabbitMQ features that integrate with AWS infrastructure services. If a feature doesn't require AWS services,
it belongs in [rabbitmq-server](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server) or other appropriate repositories instead.

While this project lives in the `amazon-mq` GitHub organization, it's designed for anyone running RabbitMQ on AWS, not just Amazon MQ users. We
welcome contributions that help the community run RabbitMQ on AWS. The best features are ones that solve problems many users face when
deploying RabbitMQ on AWS infrastructure.
